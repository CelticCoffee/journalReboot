                <h2>The Journal Begins</h2>
                <p>
                 The Web Foundations class is a room full of hopeful, determined, brave people. It’s not easy to try something new and like many of my colleagues I am throwing all of my (nonexistent) spare time into a foundation of learning to code. I am grateful to be gathering with others who believe they can do it. I think we can. I enjoy the personalities of the instructors, my classmates and I find the subject matter fascinating. As someone who benefits from big picture concepts, I could use a little more context for some of what we’re doing—seems that we get into the details sometimes before we know why but I’ve been able to use some of the resources that we’ve been pointed to in order to clarify some of these things.</p>

                <h2>A Conversation</h2>
                <p>“Who are you?” says the young peregrine web developer to her css selector.</p>
                <p>“I am pervasive. I am in your head.” Answers the little piece of Franken-code.</p>
                <p> “But you’re not supposed to be selecting everything you greedy element selector.” Insists our heroine.</p>
                <p>“Then perhaps you need to better identify me.” Muses the selector.</p>

                <h2>Div Happy</h2>
                <p>I've been putting things into too many boxes.  Boxes within boxes within boxes... it's like I'm creating a set of virtual Russian Matryoshka dolls on my computer.  I am determined to stop this madness and pare down.</p>

                <h2>jQuery vs Wendy</h2>
                <p>I was actually excited to try out jQuery.  The javascript definitely seems like the source of the magic . . .but I was like a sight-seer strolling down the sidewalk only to whack my head against a hanging 2x4.  Then I lost confidence and in order to get it back, I really need some help making sense of the structure of things.

                <h2>Bootstrap vs Wendy</h2>
                <p>Maybe I shouldn't make everything sound like it's a competition.  Maybe jQuery and bootstrap could become my friends.  That said, bootstrap is a whole lot friendlier to me at the meet n greet than jQuery.  My carousel carousels!  Woo-hoo!!</p>
